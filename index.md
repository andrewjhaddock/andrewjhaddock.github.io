**neural engineer** / **data scientist** / **biomedical engineer** 

Hello! I am a recent PhD graduate (Dec. 2017) from the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Univeristy of Washington (UW). Currently, I am employed as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the Department of Neurosurgery at UW Medical Center, where I am working on developing data-driven methods to enhance therapy for Parkinson's disease and essential tremor patients with implanted deep brain stimulators.

I am very broadly interested in data science, machine learning, control theory, optimization, digital health, healthcare, and neuroscience. In my research, I use a variety of physiologic sensors in clinical applications to collect, process, and interpret data and formulate actionable sets of rules by which to modify patient therapy in real-time. I envision a healthcare future in which a suite of connected wearable and implanted sensors provides real-time insights into patient well-being, relaying this information both to a remote healthcare clinic and to an implanted medical device in order to optimize patient therapy moment-by-moment. 

My research in this direction has been promising so far. I hope to continue working on these problems in years to come, and **I am actively looking for research positions in industry**. Explore my research page to find out more about the work I am doing!
